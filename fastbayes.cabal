-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Bayesian modeling algorithms accelerated for particular model structures

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         General-purpose sampling approaches like Gibbs sampling are very useful for models that have not been studied extensively. But for some cases, specialized algorithms are available because of the model's commonality (/e.g./, linear regression) or niche popularity (/e.g./, Latent Dirichlet Allocation). This package is an effort to collect such algorithms in one place.
